                            All carers are self employed and decide when they’re available to work. Most agencies have a
                            tight control over their staff. We impose no restrictions over carers. We simply expect them
                            to offer great care and make sure that people are happy and safe.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We are also committed to carers earning a fair living. Most agencies charge a minimum of 80%
                            commission, reducing a carer’s wage. We don’t. We make sure most of what you pay goes to the
                            carer who does the work.

                            A 20% commission is deducted from your payment, before being paid to the carer. This is an
                            administrative and introductory fee necessary to ensure we continue to provide this service
                            for all users. Carers are paid an minimum of £10 per hour. This is much better than
                            conventional agencies which often take 100% commission and pay carers less. Carers deserve a
                            real living wage.

                            Holm provides a safe place for families and people looking for care to find individual
                            carers, contract with them securely. Holm helps you find quality carers in your area and
                            then contact them directly. You can do this by searching for carers using your postcode and
                            filtering system, to make sure you find the carers you need. You can then book and
                            communicate with them through our site. The Carer will then confirm the appointment, or
                            possibly offer alternatives if they’re busy. The carer will receive all the information they
                            need to help before coming to your home.

                            Naturally. Carers can’t always be available when you need them. Sometimes having two people
                            help at the same time can also be a good idea. By using multiple carers, you can ensure you
                            receive great care whenever needed. It also means that you’ll have other trusted carers to
                            rely on if one decides they deserve a well earned break! You can manage all your bookings
                            from your personal profile page.

                            though, as Carers do plan their lives to help you. We can waive this rule under exceptional
                            circumstances such as emergency medical treatment. Please do contact us if you need help. In

                            Home uses the same secure online payment system as many well known companies. You can use a
                            variety of debit and credit cards, as well as PayPal. Your payment details are taken at the
                            time of booking, but payment is only taken once the Carer has confirmed the booking. Your
                            money is held by a safe third party until both you and the carer have confirmed the visit
                            was completed successfully. The Carer is then paid the following Friday. If you have made an
                            ongoing booking of appointments, then the carer will be paid after the successful completion
                            of each appointment, rather than the completion of the whole booking.

                            No. Holm’s service is carefully balanced to ensure a quality service for everyone, and make
                            sure that we can help when needed. Trying to make alternative arrangements jeopardises the
                            Carer’s future. People can be excluded from Holm for breaking our Terms and Conditions, as
                            well as having to make additional payments in order to help protect the Community.

                            In the unlikely event of a carer providing poor service, please contact Holm straight away.
                            We are here to help and want to resolve any problems you have. We take any allegations of
                            poor care, dishonesty, poor punctuality, incompetence or poor communication very seriously
                            and will take action immediately if you have concerns.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please provide as much information as possible. Holm will use this to help you decide if you
                            need to cancel any ongoing bookings, and whether you should be reimbursed for poor service.
                            It is just as important that good care is rewarded, as poor care isn’t.

                            Only the very best carers are able to provide their services on Holm. We use our experience
                            to check their skills and qualifications. We also make sure everyone has a criminal record
                            check. We set the bar very high. Only if carers are good enough to look after our loved
                            ones, are they good enough for yours.

                            No. Holm is an introductory service and does not provide care. We are therefore not required
                            to register with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Individual self-employed carers do not
                            have to register with CQC either. We do however want to ensure the highest levels of care,
                            and continuously use your feedback so that only the best carers are available on Holm.
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p>
                         According to regulatory guidelines published by the Care Quality Commission, "introductory agencies" who impose no control over ongoing care provision, but introduce carers and provide other ancillary services to facilitate a carer/care seeker relationship, have no statutory requirement to register with the CQC. HomeTouch is therefore unable to offer services such as changes to a care plan, increased frequency or intensity of care visits, back up rotas or otherwise effect control over the delivery of the care by the care worker. Care workers who provide personal care on a self-employed basis also have no requirement to be registered with the CQC providing the services offered do not extend beyond personal care. HomeTouch does however provide a suite of complimentary services as part of the care contract that enable a customer to monitor the carer’s performance. HomeTouch does not and is unable to monitor individual care performance.
